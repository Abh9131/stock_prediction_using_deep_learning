Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning models, particularly for time series forecasting. The stock market is inherently time-dependent, and accurately predicting stock prices can be beneficial for investors and analysts. For this purpose, we employ various deep learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the Prophet forecasting library.

The project demonstrates how to preprocess financial data, train different deep learning models, and evaluate their performance for stock price prediction.

Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task because stock prices are influenced by various factors such as market trends, economic indicators, political events, and investor sentiment. The goal of this project is to use deep learning models to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

The key components of the project are:

Data Collection: Obtaining historical stock data.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data into a format suitable for deep learning models.
Model Training: Training multiple deep learning models on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Comparing the performance of each model.
Prediction: Making future price predictions based on the trained models.
Basic Steps in Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on past observations. The basic steps in time series forecasting include:

Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data. This can be done using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or other data providers.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the data. You also need to convert the data into sequences to be used for model training.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features such as moving averages, price changes, and technical indicators.

Model Training: Train the forecasting models using historical data.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

Prediction: Make predictions using the trained model.

Models Used
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Overview: A simple feed-forward neural network consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. It is trained using backpropagation.
Application: ANN is used here to model the relationship between historical stock prices and future predictions.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Overview: RNNs are a class of neural networks designed for sequential data. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have loops in their architecture that allow information to persist.
Application: RNNs are suitable for time series forecasting, where past information is crucial for making future predictions.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Overview: LSTM is a type of RNN that is designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and can capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
Application: LSTM networks are commonly used for stock price prediction due to their ability to handle long sequences of data.
Prophet
Overview: Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It is based on an additive model that includes components for trend, seasonality, and holidays.
Application: Prophet is used here as a simpler alternative for time series forecasting. It works well for stock price data and is easy to use and tune.

Required Libraries:
numpy: For numerical computations.
pandas: For data manipulation.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities.
tensorflow/keras: For deep learning models.
fbprophet: For time series forecasting.
yfinance: For downloading stock price data.
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing step is crucial to ensure that the model can learn meaningful patterns from the historical stock prices.

Steps for Preprocessing:
Download Data: Use yfinance or another API to download historical stock data (e.g., daily closing prices).
Handle Missing Data: Fill or drop missing values.
Normalization: Scale the data to ensure that input values fall within a specific range, typically [0, 1].
Create Sequences: For time series forecasting, the data needs to be converted into sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 30 days of stock prices to predict the next day's price).
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).
Model Training and Evaluation
ANN Model
Define the architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer).
Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
Train the model using the training data and evaluate using the test data.
RNN Model
Create an RNN model using LSTM or GRU layers to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
Compile and train the model similarly to the ANN model.
Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE.
LSTM Model
Use LSTM layers for better performance on sequential data.
Train and evaluate the LSTM model using similar steps as above.
Prophet Model
Fit a Prophet model to the historical data.
Tune the seasonalities and holidays for better accuracy.
Make future predictions using the trained Prophet model.
Results
The evaluation results of the models (ANN, RNN, LSTM, and Prophet) are shown based on their performance on the test dataset. Key metrics to compare include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Graphs of actual vs. predicted prices for each model are also included to visualize the prediction performance.

Conclusion
In this project, we demonstrated the application of various deep learning models (ANN, RNN, LSTM) and traditional forecasting techniques (Prophet) for stock price prediction. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses:

ANN: Simple and quick to implement, but may not capture temporal dependencies well.
RNN: Better at handling sequences, but may struggle with long-term dependencies.
LSTM: Excellent for capturing long-range dependencies in stock price data.
Prophet: Simple and effective for capturing seasonality, trends, and holidays, but less flexible than deep learning models.
